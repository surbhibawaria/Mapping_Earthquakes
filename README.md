# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. The mission is to choose to accept, it will be to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes around the world. Basil, the head of the earthquake disaster response team believes that this project will be useful for his team which includes reporters and data visualization specialists. He hopes that making earthquake maps informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones will generate postivite buzz about the Disaster Reporting Network.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to support websiote and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. To traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. 

On the map, the magnitude and location of each earthquake will be shown in a popup marker. The diameter of the marker for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquake with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing the context for your map data. 

Finally, to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, fault lines are added on the map and the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
